## Artificial intelligence
At its heart, AI is computer programming that learns and adapts.

### Artificial intelligence is the name given to any computer system taught to mimic intelligent human behaviors.
It refers to anything from programs taught how to play board games and translate languages to complex systems that can have human-sounding conversations, analyze the stock market or help to diagnose health conditions.

#### AI is powering practical tools that exist all around us.
These technologies already show up in everyday life — helping to organize photos on our smartphones or plan a commute to work. They take tasks that have historically required considerable human intellect and work through them using computer programming.

The last decade has seen major progress, sparked by increasing computer speeds and the introduction of techniques such as machine learning. As a result, AI is now becoming increasingly woven into the way we live, work and make sense of the world.

Ultimately, the future of these technologies will depend heavily on what people decide to do with them, but the promise they have to transform human challenges is becoming clear.

## Bias
Incomplete data can lead to bias in AI.

### The results of AI systems can be affected by data that amplifies existing biases found in the real world.
Typically, AI forms a bias when the data it’s given to learn from isn’t fully comprehensive and, therefore, starts leading it toward certain outcomes. Because data is an AI system’s only means of learning, it could end up reproducing any imbalances or biases found within the original information.

For example, if you were teaching AI to recognize shoes and only showed it imagery of sneakers, it wouldn’t learn to recognize high heels, sandals or boots as shoes.

#### Bias makes it challenging to develop AI that works for everyone.
No AI system is complex enough, nor dataset deep enough, to represent and understand humanity in all its diversity. This can present profound challenges when you consider the potential AI has to influence the experiences of real people.

A job-matching AI shortlisting candidates for CEO interviews might learn to favor men simply because it was given successful resumes to learn from and, historically, there was a societal bias toward male candidates.

To ensure that AI systems are ethical and reduce the risk of bias, programmers design their systems and curate their data vigilantly. This is the only way to ensure that systems work well for everybody.

## Climate
AI is being used to tackle global climate challenges.

### People all over the world are using AI to help address the unprecedented crisis our planet is facing.
Monitoring climate change involves vast and constantly evolving datasets. AI systems can help to analyze collections of environmental information, to track real-time changes in climate conditions, reduce inefficiencies, and identify vital opportunities for humanity to find solutions that could have a positive impact on our planet, faster.

#### In meeting some of humanity’s greatest challenges, AI can be a powerful tool.
AI-powered systems are helping us to regulate the amount of energy wasted at home by turning off the heating and lights when we leave the house.

Around the world, they’re helping to combat drought by monitoring areas affected by desertification.

They’re being used to model melting glaciers and predict rising sea levels so effective action can be taken.

Other systems are helping to find new chemical structures needed to create solar fuels from sunlight.

Researchers are also considering the environmental impact of data centers and AI computing itself; for example, exploring how to develop more energy efficient systems and infrastructures.

AI is only one tool in the process of understanding the complexity of climate change, but its ability to process large volumes of data and uncover patterns offers us the opportunity to build greater understanding of the ecosystem.

## Datasets
The information used to teach AI about the world.

### Datasets are large collections of digital information that are used to train AI.
They might contain anything from weather data, such as air pressure and temperature, to photos, music, or indeed anything else that helps an AI system with the task it has been assigned.

#### Datasets are like textbooks for computers.
Just as a child learns through examples, the same is true of machines. Datasets are the bedrock of this learning process.

AI design teams have to carefully consider the data they choose to train their AI with, and may build in parameters that help the system make sense of the information it’s given.

For this reason, AI design teams often share datasets for the benefit of the wider scientific community, making it easier to collaborate and build on each other's research.

## Ethics
Guidelines that govern how AI is built and used.

### Much like ethical codes and laws that govern society, ethical guidelines help shape the way AI is developed.
Any powerful technology raises questions about its use. Society takes into account not just how a technology will be used to solve problems, but how it might be misused — codes of conduct and guidelines can help to safeguard against that.

#### AI has brought a variety of ethical considerations with it.
Systems that can function with minimal human guidance are bound to raise debate about the level of restriction required. In addition, some AI systems are so complex in their calculations that it may not be easy for humans to check how they reached their output. As such, society may not feel comfortable assigning them to certain tasks without extensive testing and putting other safeguards in place.

Thoughtful businesses are continuously examining and revising the ethical frameworks that guide their AI projects, and communities dedicated to exploring the ethics of AI open up new conversations that evolve alongside these technologies.

## Fakes
Fake images, audio or video made using AI.

### AI has given rise to new ways for technologies to create hyper-realistic “deepfake” images, speech, music and video.
Deepfakes work by studying existing real-world imagery or audio, mapping them in detail, then manipulating them to create works of fiction that are disconcertingly true to life.

These technologies, considered impossible just a handful of years ago, have found a wide variety of applications across everything from CGI in Hollywood movies to music production and pornography. While many are intended to be entertaining and imaginative, used inappropriately they can also generate misinformation that may be harmful to society: convincing fakes injected into public discourse can do significant damage to public knowledge and trust.

#### Fakes can be convincing, but there are some telltale signs that distinguish them from reality.
In fakes of recent years, visual renders of people may look a little glitchy, like computer games. Voices might sound a bit robotic. Characters also blink less or repeat their hand gestures, as it can be tricky for creators to find, map and replicate source material of people with their eyes shut or hands exposed.

As fakes become more sophisticated, the methods and technologies used to detect them must also remain in a constant state of evolution.

## GANs
Two AI systems that learn by competing with each other.

### Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are pairs of AI systems trained to create content and accomplish tasks faster than one system working alone.
Imagine the task is to generate an image inspired by the artistic style of Picasso. AI design teams could gather together all of Picasso’s paintings and train a GAN to spot the colors, characteristics and individual brushstrokes that make his artworks unique.

#### One AI system would attempt to copy Picasso’s work, while the other judges its attempts.
The copycat applies its knowledge to producing thousands of new images in the style of Picasso — drawing on features from existing artworks — while the other AI system judges how similar the creations are to Picasso’s style and rates them. Any that aren’t convincing are given back to the copycat for improvement.

Eventually, after bouncing ideas back and forth millions of times, the copycat gets better and better at creating paintings in the style of Picasso.

The ability for GANs to go beyond simply memorizing what’s been made before to create new content was believed to be an important milestone within the AI research community. Designers and architects are already exploring their potential to help generate 3-D models of cars and buildings, based on the study of 2-D photos.

## Human-in-the-loop
A human being who guides an AI system as it learns.

### The Human-in-the-loop is someone who trains, tests or tunes an AI system to help it produce more reliable results.
Just as a student mastering an activity for the first time would likely make mistakes, or misunderstand certain nuances, the same is true of AI.

A human-in-the-loop can intervene to teach the system which distinguishing features to look out for and guide it toward more accurate answers.

#### Giving a computer a human guide means two completely different kinds of intelligence are being leveraged simultaneously.
By providing data for an AI system to study and validating its efforts during its process of trial and error, humans lend the wisdom they’ve built up over a lifetime and combine it with the speed of computing. This collaborative dynamic helps to account for the drawbacks of both people and machines to achieve more accurate results.

## Image recognition
How AI systems learn to "see" the world around them.

### Image recognition is the technology that enables AI to recognize and categorize objects in the world around us.
Sometimes known as "computer vision," image recognition systems can be taught to recognize anything from individuals to famous landmarks, or even pets, simply by studying a range of reference images provided for them.

The systems can then help with everyday tasks, like organizing smartphone photos; for example, automatically suggesting a new album for vacation photos after a trip.

#### Each image is like a fingerprint.
AI systems are trained to spot identifying features — such as colors and shapes — and cross-reference them with thousands of other images in order to recognize and label them accurately.

The same technology that can recognize landmarks and group vacation photos is also being put to more profound use elsewhere, helping to translate warning signs in foreign languages or protect children from explicit content online.

## Journalism
Journalists are using AI to transform the news industry.

### For newsrooms, AI systems that can process volumes of data in real time are useful tools.
Journalists around the world are exploring how AI can help monitor news sources, organize information, find unexpected links and distribute stories.

AI systems are generally being used to support newsrooms in three areas:

During the research process: AI is being used to automate the transcription of interviews, monitor events as they unfold, translate foreign news sources, gather relevant posts from social media and cross-reference archived stories, reports and records to find additional insights.

During the writing process: AI is helping with fact-checking, suggesting grammar and sentence structure improvements, and tailoring articles to a variety of different audiences by monitoring things like local crime, education and housing statistics.

During distribution: AI is being applied to automatically analyzing and tagging news features with subject matter labels so that readers who have a history of enjoying similar topics can find related content.

#### Ultimately, AI systems are helping to help speed up fact-finding and automate daily newsroom tasks.
In a world where we generate huge amounts of information, but resources are increasingly tight, AI can support journalists by reducing the amount of background work they have to do so that they can focus on the thing they do best — telling the world’s stories.

## Knowledge
AI systems build knowledge in a fundamentally different way from humans.

### The knowledge an AI system attains is very different from the intricate knowledge human beings develop over the course of a lifetime.
Humans make sense of the world by automatically drawing on previous life experience to contextualize everything around them. But AI systems don’t have the same kind of background knowledge to call on, or the instinct to do so.

AI systems must be explicitly taught how to cross-reference and analyze a broad spectrum of information, in the form of organized data, in order to build up their experience. There are ceilings and boundaries to what they can learn, determined by the parameters put in place by AI design teams.

#### Knowledge is as far from information as wisdom is from knowledge.
Take an AI system trained to spot a parrot in a set of bird photos. It does not "understand" what a parrot is. It can learn to spot identifying features, such as the colorful feathers and curved beak, but a system’s knowledge is constrained by the kind of information it is given to learn from.

## Learning
The different methods used to teach AI.

### Two of the most common techniques that AI design teams use to train machine learning systems are supervised and unsupervised learning.
In supervised learning, a system is given reference data, which it can use to look for similar patterns in new data. It learns through a process of iteration: trial and error.

Imagine someone wanted to teach a system to recognize different fruits. You might start by showing the system photos labeled as pineapples. Next time it comes across a spiky, knobbly ball in a fruit bowl, it should be able to identify it.

In unsupervised learning, a system is closely watched by its developers but can be taught to look for relationships in data by itself. You could show a system images of a range of fruits —without telling it which were which — and ask it to find similarities and differences between them. It might group together all the spiky, knobbly balls and suggest they are in fact the same thing, but it wouldn’t know they were pineapples unless it was told.

#### Unsurprisingly, the way we teach AI affects the way it learns.
Supervised learning methods are able to categorize and label data according to what humans already know, while unsupervised methods can be used for spotting patterns that people may not necessarily know to look for.

## Machine learning
When AI learns for itself through data and experience.

### Machine learning enables AI systems to come up with their own solutions, rather than being preprogrammed with a set of answers.
In traditional programming, if you wanted to teach a computer to draw a cat, you’d have to explain the drawing process in precise detail. With machine learning, you feed an AI system thousands of cat sketches to analyze and let it look for patterns by itself.

Over time, it begins to recognize the features that make up a cat — such as pointy ears and whiskers — and develops a more flexible, nuanced understanding of what constitutes a cat sketch.

With these pattern-spotting capabilities, machine learning helps AI systems make sense of vast quantities of data.

### Machine learning can complete certain tasks at great speed and scale.
Conservationists use it to analyze months of underwater recordings and pinpoint whale migration patterns, while medical diagnosticians use it to examine multitudes of scans at once in order to identify the earliest signs of disease

## Neural networks
AI systems inspired by the human brain.

### Neural networks allow for a different kind of learning than traditional AI: inspired by, but very different from, human thought.
Neural networks are made up of collections of information-processing units that work as a team, passing information between them similar to the way neurons do inside the brain. Together, these networks are able to take on greater challenges with more complexity and detail than traditional programming can handle.

#### Although they attempt to mimic the structure of the brain, neural networks cannot "think" like humans.
Human beings can instantly analyze thousands of tiny details to make sense of new objects and scenarios, taking in multiple characteristics simultaneously, like color, texture and size. Neural networks are adept at spotting patterns but are not capable of contextualizing those details the same way humans can.

AI design teams can assign each piece of a network to recognizing one of many characteristics. The sections of the network then work as one to build an understanding of the relationships and correlations between those elements — working out how they typically fit together and influence each other.

By studying data provided by the network’s design team, these detail-oriented systems are able to gain an acute eye for subtle patterns within this information — enabling AI to succeed at data-intensive tasks that traditional computing couldn’t even attempt.

## Open source
Code and data that’s free for anyone to use.

### When people describe something as "open source," it means code has been uploaded to the web, to be shared with anyone.
This practice is common in software development, as it enables anybody to download pre-existing code, data or research, study it, learn from it, adapt it to their own programs and problems and build new variants of it however they choose.

#### Open source is all about sharing and developing ideas to build effective systems.
The code and datasets created by AI design teams tend to be difficult to organize and can take a lot of work to pull together. Open sourcing can save programmers from the time-consuming process of building new, similar systems from the ground up. It also enables collaborators to spot vulnerabilities or bugs that creators might’ve missed.

The practice enables more people to participate in the process and helps communities around the world to collectively further one another’s knowledge, leading to potentially more secure, more effective AI.

## Predictions
An AI system’s output is a prediction of how likely something is to occur.

### Computer scientists often refer to the output of AI systems as predictions, even when they don’t have anything obvious to do with the future.
For example, AI’s recommendation of a book is a prediction that you’ll like it.

These predictive systems show up everywhere in today’s society, from simply suggesting which films or videos you might like based on your previous tastes to increasing the accuracy of the weather forecast by examining previous weather patterns.

#### AI-powered predictions are helping people with everyday decision making.
Given sufficient information to work with, they can enable us to navigate decisions with more certainty, not just in our reading lists but across everything — from being better prepared for future natural disasters to managing our investments.

## Quantum computing
A new generation of computers that process information in a completely different way.

### Quantum computers are a new wave of machines with the potential to use AI to solve problems that would take conventional computers a very long time.
These quantum machines process information in entirely different ways and dimensions to the computers that power AI systems of today. Whereas conventional computers process information as a series of 0s or 1s (binary code), quantum computers can use 0 and 1 simultaneously.

#### Just as humans are capable of holding a 0 and a 1 in their mind at the same time, quantum computers can essentially do the same.
Their ability to perform many computations at once substantially cuts processing time, meaning that quantum computers could enable AI systems to complete tasks in seconds that would take the fastest supercomputers thousands of years—thus giving researchers the capacity to find meaningful answers to complex problems almost instantaneously.

While it is unclear how long it will be until these machines make their way out of the research labs and into the world, they have the potential to dramatically speed up computational tasks — to such a degree that it could become possible to granularly analyze medical treatment and find out whether a particular medicine is effectively targeting specific molecules in the body.

## Robotics
The study of machines built to automate tasks.

### Robotics experts are dedicated to creating programmable machines, known as robots.
Today, AI is enabling robots to perform many new tasks, but they have been part of our lives for decades: from elevators to washing machines, automated vacuum cleaners to giant mechanical arms on factory production lines. The term "robots" also covers pieces of software used to automate digital activities, not just physical labor—these are commonly called "bots."

Historically, robots have been designed to carry out basic activities in order to ease people’s workloads. With the introduction of AI, a new generation of robotics has become possible — one in which robots have the ability to analyze and navigate tasks in-the-moment that were previously too hard to automate.

#### AI is helping to create robots that are more capable, useful and purposeful.
Learning about the depths of the ocean used to involve sending human beings encased in submarines into crushing pressures. AI-enabled robots now plunge into the ocean deep for us, making marine research safer, faster and more efficient.

Equipped with AI programming, robots can autonomously chart the ocean floor and perform activities like capturing photos that identify known organisms, as well as pinpointing new ones that researchers never knew existed, and flagging unexplored habitats for analysis.

## Speech recognition
Technology that helps AI to understand human speech.

### Speech recognition systems are trained to recognize what human beings are saying.
These systems form the backbone of everything from dictation software to language translation tools to voice-activated smart speakers.

#### While machines may recognize speech, this does not mean they understand it the way humans do.
Human beings can understand language, even out of context or if the sentence comes out jumbled. Machines find this harder.

"Natural language processing" is a recent advancement in speech recognition that enables AI to draw on grammatical rules and analyze live speech in order to better understand the complex ways people speak. This helps AI systems to grasp how something such as tone or humor might alter the meaning of a sentence.

These technologies are steadily evolving to understand not just what we say, but what we mean. With AI design teams continuously looking for ways to build more nuance into their systems, people are having more seamless, natural interactions with AI than ever.

## Turing test
A famous test that posed the question: "Can machines think?"

### The Turing test has a simple premise: if a human being can have a five-minute conversation without realizing they’re talking to a machine, the computer passes the test.
Invented in 1950 by pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing, the test laid the foundations for what we now call AI by asking whether it was possible for a machine to imitate human thought.

#### Simply because a system can retrieve an answer that sounds like understanding, doesn’t mean it understands.
Interestingly, many of the successful systems to date could convince someone that they were talking to a person, not with convincing human conversation but by throwing in spelling errors or grammatical mistakes. The skills required to appear human and pass the test are not necessarily linked with "intelligence" and "thinking."

Nevertheless, Turing’s test led many scientists and engineers to consider what makes us inherently human and inspired AI design teams everywhere to strive for computer systems that interact in more natural, human-like ways.

## Uses
How AI shows up in the world today.

### AI is rapidly finding its way out of research labs and into everyday lifestyles.
From the smart speakers in our homes to space exploration and agriculture, these AI systems are augmenting human abilities through the power of computing.

#### AI is proving crucial to advancing science and tackling some of our biggest global challenges.
There are now systems that can examine citywide traffic information in real time to help people efficiently plan their route to work.

There are apps that cross-reference enormous databases to help farmers identify issues with their crops.

There are programs that juggle huge amounts of live flight data, enabling airlines to plan more efficient flight paths and maximize cargo space to reduce carbon emissions.

These systems are opening up new ways to solve problems across every facet of life. Ultimately, the future of how AI is applied and used will be determined by what people decide to do with it.

## Virtual assistants
AI-powered applications that carry out tasks for people.

### A virtual assistant is an increasingly common use of AI that responds to commands and questions to help people get things done.
They’re essentially a digital take on a human assistant. The most recognizable examples are the voice assistants people speak to via smartphones and smart speakers. Day to day, these assistants help people to search for information online, play music or answer basic questions.

#### As people's lives and homes become more connected, virtual assistants can help to perform new tasks more easily.
Today’s assistants are already able to run fairly sophisticated errands, such as switching the heating on before someone gets home, ordering food from their favorite takeout, or informing travelers of flight changes before they get to the airport.

Being responsive to spoken commands not only makes these assistants easy and efficient to use, but also benefits those who find keyboards challenging whether due to literacy issues, disability or other reasons.

Powered by AI learning, the natural language systems that virtual assistants use to understand the context of questions and interpret human voices are creating more natural conversations between people and their devices.

## Watson
The first AI system to beat a human contestant on a TV game show.

### In 2011 IBM created Watson — an AI system that challenged two humans to a game of the U.S. quiz show "Jeopardy!" and won.
#### Watson based its answers on the contents of millions of books, dictionaries and encyclopedias.
Once Watson had been taught the unique structure of Jeopardy! questions from previous examples, the system developed a way to find the answers to new questions within a fraction of a second.

Programmers trained the AI to not only search for keywords within content but to also analyze and decipher the sentences around those keywords. That way, Watson could cross-reference different contextual sources to work out that "tea" was not only a drink, but also a type of dress from the 1940s (and the answer to an $800 question).

However, if the host asked a question in an unexpected way, using a sentence structure that the programmers hadn’t anticipated, Watson would fumble. Watson’s lack of conversational context, which humans naturally have, also made some questions almost indecipherable to the AI.

This proved instrumental to the scientific community, as it shined a light on the need for flexible AI systems trained on robust examples of human speech and informed the way that natural language systems are built today, such as those that power the virtual assistants we have conversations with in our homes and on our phones.

## X-ray
AI is helping doctors to analyze X-rays and diagnose patients faster.

### Many radiologists are now using AI-powered tools to study X-rays, spot abnormalities and diagnose people’s illnesses faster and (potentially) more accurately.
In fact, any medical practitioner who diagnoses patients by reviewing imagery — such as those who look for cancer cells in biopsies or signs of Alzheimer's in brain scans — can now carry out their work more efficiently using AI.

AI-based imaging systems are trained with thousands of existing scans so that they learn to identify anomalies that might indicate the onset of disease. These systems are then able to flag a particular area of an X-ray for closer scrutiny by a doctor. The AI and the doctor are thus complementary.

#### AI can greatly accelerate the analysis of datasets and generate diagnoses more rapidly.
The ability for AI to run a detailed research process in seconds enables doctors to make comprehensive reviews faster. Forward-thinking doctors are leading the way in exploring how this combination of human and machine intelligence can be leveraged to enhance medical care.

The life-saving potential of tools such as these will only increase as more reference images are gathered from an even more diverse range of cases covering illnesses relating to more populations.

## You
For AI to understand the world, it needs to understand "you".

### It’s impossible to teach a machine the complexity of what it means to be human.
You could give an AI system all the data in the world and it still wouldn’t reflect, or understand, every human being on the planet. We are multidimensional characters that sit outside the realm of 2-D data that machines use to make sense of things.

#### Many of the systems that shape our world also end up shaping our perception of ourselves.
AI systems are trained and guided by humans, from the developers and programmers who build them to the individuals who use them.

As such, it is up to each person to choose how they interact with AI systems and what information they feel comfortable sharing. How much you allow AI to learn about "you" is controlled by you.

Over time, as more of these AI systems show up in our lives, humans can help open them up to a more thorough understanding of the social nuances, contexts and relationships that make each of us unique.

## Zeros & ones
The fundamental building blocks of computing.

### 0s and 1s are the foundational language of computers. Known as "binary code," they are the means by which AI systems process information.
Different versions of binary code have been around for centuries; for example, braille uses patterns of raised bumps to convey information to blind people. Morse code uses a series of long and short signals. Everything a computer does is translated into 0s and 1s that can be strung together into sequences to transmit information, whether it’s music, film, imagery, language or something else.

#### 01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100001 may not look like much to you, but this binary sequence spells out "Hello."
A binary approach to processing information can also be a limitation in AI: where systems handle extraordinary amounts of data to build an understanding of our world and solve problems that are rarely binary in nature.

As we head into the future and computers become increasingly capable, evolving into supercomputers and, someday, quantum computers, an opportunity for AI systems to become even more complex is opening up.
